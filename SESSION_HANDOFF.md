# FreeCAD-Az — recovery handoff

**Updated:** 2026-11-05
**Repository:** https://github.com/Mr-Azrack/FreeCAD-Az
**Development branch:** codex/az-design-workbench
**Reviewed implementation commit:** dac67fee9cebb9cb7e342a45098fd913510f10f6 (Az Design 0.2)
**Draft PR:** https://github.com/Mr-Azrack/FreeCAD-Az/pull/1

This is a checkpoint, **not a pinned current HEAD**. Always fetch branch HEAD and inspect new commits before work. Other sessions may be pushing code simultaneously.

## Verified from repository inspection

- Az Design 0.2 extends the earlier workbench with exact selectable sketch regions, live solid workflows, viewport handles, user parameters, supported Press/Pull, rollback and suppression, and native/parametric feature compatibility. Read addons/AzDesign/README.md for details.
- v0.2 package is addons/releases/AzDesign-0.2.0.zip; installer macro is addons/Install_AzDesign.FCMacro.
- addons/AzDesign/tests/validation-v02-linux.json records 26 passing modeling tests, four installer tests, passed v0.2 GUI and previous native/navigation checks, and manual viewport-drag observations. These are **recorded prior results**, not tests rerun by this handoff session.
- Environment of recorded validation: Linux, FreeCAD 1.0.0, Qt5/PySide2. Windows/macOS/Qt6/FreeCAD 1.1 not verified.
- While preparing this protocol, the active branch advanced from ab4a2ab3 to dac67fee. The continuity files were committed on top of that newer implementation rather than clobbering it.
- This checkpoint only adds documentation. CAD code functionality was not modified by the continuity commits.

## Immediate actions

1. Fetch current branch and verify HEAD, PR status, check runs, changed paths, and any uncommitted edits. Inspect new changes since the baseline above.
2. Read AGENTS.md, PROJECT_STATE.md, DECISIONS.md, ROADMAP.md, and the latest addons/AzDesign/README.md.
3. Run Windows shop-machine installation and a representative fabrication workflow; log exact versions and results. Be mindful v0.2 custom features require Az installed to recompute.
4. Select next Stage 1 usability gap based on actual Windows modeling experience; define an acceptance test, implement in small commits, test, and advance the draft PR.
5. Update the continuity docs with actual results and a specific next action before leaving the session.

## Timeout/crash/compaction recovery checklist

- **Never trust a recovered Work session's recollection as authoritative.**
- When local git exists: inspect git remote -v; git branch --show-current; git rev-parse HEAD; git status --short; git log -5 --oneline; git diff; git diff --cached.
- If only GitHub tools are available, inspect branch HEAD, PR, commits and files. You cannot claim a clean worktree without checking the local environment.
- Reconcile discrepancies with verified repository evidence. Preserve uncommitted changes, avoid blind resets, and do not retry a possibly completed operation without inspecting outcomes.
- Resume from the first genuinely uncompleted work item and update this handoff at the next checkpoint.

## Required end-of-session entry

Record: date/time; actual branch and HEAD; exact files/commits; tests run and results; CI/PR status; uncommitted changes; open risks; next reproducible action; any local-only artifacts or tool/environment limits.

**Rule:** Git is the authoritative memory, and this handoff points to it.

## Implementation-session completion update — 2026-11-05

**Tested code:** `dac67fee9cebb9cb7e342a45098fd913510f10f6`. **Inspected docs parent:**
`f500e7271468a21ff3e7b9d3ad8a8fe1c9c400d2`. This update preserves the concurrent
continuity edits and adds fresh implementation/CI facts; query Git for the new tip.

The implementation session ran and passed 26 native tests, 27 desktop workflow
checks, 30 original modeling/navigation checks and 4 installer tests on FreeCAD
1.0/Linux/Qt5. Manual mouse dragging and cross-call Cancel passed. Native Fillet
survives upstream Az dimension edits; mixed native/Az history reopens. The checked-in
`validation-v02-linux.json` contains the evidence. Windows remains untested.

[CI run 42100114683](https://github.com/Mr-Azrack/FreeCAD-Az/actions/runs/42100114683)
passed package and native modeling jobs. Inherited Dependency Review is blocked by
this fork's disabled/unsupported Dependency graph; repository-wide CI is not all green.
PR #1 remains draft. No merge to main or repository setting change was performed.

Source, installer and evidence are committed; no CAD implementation changes remain
uncommitted. Local launchers, fault probes and generated example FCStd files were
transient diagnostics outside the checkout and are not needed for recovery. Next:
perform the Windows shop-part acceptance workflow listed above, record actual
versions/results, then choose the next measured usability gap. Do not duplicate the
already implemented profile selection, parameters, Q or rollback from stale notes.

## Startup failure follow-up — 0.2.1

Parent inspected before this fix: `8b27bb09993a40d4c52b64f210951cb17aee5c40`.
Owner's Windows FreeCAD v1-1 installation failed while executing InitGui.py because
`__file__` was absent. Init.py had the same bug. It was hidden by earlier manual
GUI launchers that injected a file value. Startup workbench code moved into
`azdesign/workbench.py`; both entry scripts now import normally. Added five loader
regressions to package CI. All five fail against 0.2.0 and pass against 0.2.1; the
four installer tests also pass. A full installed FreeCAD 1.0/Linux restart
automatically registered the workbench and activated its ribbon. Evidence and
platform limits are recorded in
`addons/AzDesign/tests/validation-startup-0.2.1.json`.

New installer: `addons/releases/AzDesign-0.2.1.zip`. The owner should extract it,
rerun Install_AzDesign.FCMacro and restart FreeCAD, then confirm startup and run the
Windows shop-part workflow. Do not reuse the known-broken 0.2.0 startup entry files.
The modeling engine is unchanged by this hotfix. Full Windows/1.1 modeling support
must not be inferred from the startup fix or earlier Linux results. Read current
branch HEAD and PR #1 before resuming; keep the branch under review.

### Published 0.2.1 verification checkpoint

Startup fix/source commit: `0242b3a6f7b23026a2b33e63ad6e04ac5c5763e0`.
[Add-on CI run 42162682276](https://github.com/Mr-Azrack/FreeCAD-Az/actions/runs/42162682276)
passed for that commit, including the new startup regressions and native modeling/
installer/package jobs. The ZIP is `addons/releases/AzDesign-0.2.1.zip`, SHA256
`c65900d15c337f619e34a8d2fb719bdd75426ad4a68b8b39f8ec9e0e2ee0bd8d`.
PR #1 remains draft and main is unchanged. The inherited Dependency Review setting
issue persists. The remaining immediate action is the owner's Windows/1.1 reinstall
and startup/modeling retest; Linux startup validation does not close that gate.
